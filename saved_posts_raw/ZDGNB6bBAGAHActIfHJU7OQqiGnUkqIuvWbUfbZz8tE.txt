Hot take: VC backed AI-native medical practice is just rebranded tech-enabled medical practice with an AI assistant marketed as an AI doctor. 

Why is this the case? 

Because theres really only one way to offer direct care services to consumers in the U.S. in all 50 states legally, while navigating licensure, billing, CPoM, and employment laws or regulations. 

We learned this week why tech-enabled care delivery failed, yet here we are again using the same foundational structure with new AI technology expecting different results. 

We also know that these models require employing TONs of expensive engineers, designers, PMs, QA, etc meaning theyll have to make concessions on clinical talent which is also expensive. So theyll most likely choose to hire 1099 and we already know the average panel size that these clinicians can manage with a D2C or tech-enabled option. 

MSO-PC: 1900 panel size for a 1099 (not full-time) contractor - there are STRICT employment laws on this! So that number is very difficult to increase without risking compliance. 

Full-time: 2500 panel size even with monitoring chat or as the human in the loop for queue systems which can average 40 cases a day.

In comparison if we allowed each individual doctor in the U.S. to create and manage their own AI doctor twin the panel size could be  since its not bound by the MSO-PC structure limitations and can be managed locally (safer) where patients still have access to doctors in-person if necessary.

tl;dr - AI doctor companies marketing that AI doctors solve the doctor shortage problem is a lie. Doctors still require oversight and governance and in order to provide care delivery services across all 50 states it requires a standard MSO-PC entity structure. MSO-PCs have several limitations with employment, licensure, and compliance which keeps the AI doctor from ever offering services autonomously.
