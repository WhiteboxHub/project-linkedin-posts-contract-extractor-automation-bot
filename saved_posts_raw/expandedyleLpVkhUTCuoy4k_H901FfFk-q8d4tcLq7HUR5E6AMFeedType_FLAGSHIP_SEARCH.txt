She never attended the event.
And it changed everything.

While classmates networked at campus fests, she sat in a Tier-3 college asking:

"How do I compete when I'm invisible?"

The answer wasn't another event.
It was AI + LinkedIn.

What she did:

1. AI-optimized her profile
 Headline: "Student"  "Aspiring Data Analyst | Python | SQL"
 Keywords recruiters actually search

2. Engaged 15 mins daily
 Thoughtful comments, not emojis
 Visibility from her hostel room

3. Shared her progress
 Mini-projects + course wins
 Authentic > perfect

4. Personalized connection requests
 AI-powered, specific mentions
 40% acceptance vs 10% average

5. Comments became conversations
 One caught a mentor's eye
 Mentor recommended her for a role
 Now placed at Bangalore startup

She never attended that networking event.

But her inbox is full of opportunities.

42.6% of Indian graduates struggle with employability.
87% of recruiters use LinkedIn to find talent.

Your profile is your bridge from rural classroom to global opportunity.

You don't need campus fests.
You need consistency + AI + strategy.
