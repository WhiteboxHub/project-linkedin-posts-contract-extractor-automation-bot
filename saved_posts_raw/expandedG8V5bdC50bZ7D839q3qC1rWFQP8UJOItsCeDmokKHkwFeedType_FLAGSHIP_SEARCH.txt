We're hiring a BD Lead AI consultant. No fluff. 

You'd work with AcceLLM, a 15-person AI/ML engineering firm based in Singapore, and CS Solutions, the US consulting arm. We build production AI systems for companies that are done talking about it and ready to ship.

I need a Business Development Lead who can hunt. You'd be sourcing enterprise deals, consulting with CTOs on how AI fits their business, and helping build two brands into household names in the AI consulting space.

I am always actively mentoring on the technology/AI front so if you can hustle don't hesitate to apply.

This is a 1099, commission-only role. 5-10% on every deal you source  that's $3K-$10K+ per closed project, with many leading to retainers. No cap. Remote. Full flexibility.

The right person has 4+ years in B2B sales (ideally tech/SaaS), can talk AI without faking it, and thrives without a safety net. 

This is ground-floor  the path to salaried or equity is real as we scale.

If that sounds like you, or you know someone built for this, DM me, email me (clarence@clarencestephen.com) or apply here:
