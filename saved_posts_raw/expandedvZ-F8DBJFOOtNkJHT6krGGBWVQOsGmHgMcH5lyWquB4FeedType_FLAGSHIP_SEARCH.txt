Machine Learning is no longer just about building models its about building impact.
Over the years, Ive seen ML evolve from experimentation to production-grade systems that drive real business outcomes:
 Turning raw data into actionable insights
 Deploying scalable ML pipelines in cloud environments
 Monitoring, retraining, and governing models in production
 Blending traditional ML with Generative AI and agentic workflows
The real challenge isnt choosing the algorithm its designing reliable, explainable, and scalable ML systems that teams can trust.
Excited to continue working on ML solutions that bridge data, engineering, and business value
