 A $75 million startup just proved that AI won't just change accountingit will completely redefine it.

Here's what makes this a game-changer:

 AI agents that function as actual tax preparersnot just assistants

The results from their pilot programs are staggering:

 85% reduction in preparation time
 60% reduction in review time

This isn't about replacing accountantsit's about freeing them from manual data entry to focus on strategic advisory work.
