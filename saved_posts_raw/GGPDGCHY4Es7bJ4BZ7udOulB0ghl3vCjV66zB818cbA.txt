Companies say they want engineers who can build with AI.

Very few are already shipping it in production.

I am.

I work as a Full-Stack Engineer building real enterprise platforms powered by:
 .NET Core
 Angular / React
 Azure Cloud
 SQL
 Microservices & REST APIs
 Fast APIs, Open APIs

Recently, my focus has been on integrating Azure OpenAI into CRM and healthcare-style environments to solve practical, workflow-level challenges.
What that looks like in action:
 Converting lengthy notes into clear, usable summaries
 Generating contextual response suggestions
 Improving search accuracy with embeddings
 Reducing manual effort for operations teams
 Securing systems using RBAC & Key Vault
 Delivering reliably through Docker & Azure DevOps CI/CD

This is production engineering.
Not demos. Not experiments.

Open to:
 Full-time (FTE / W2)
 Contract (W2 / C2C where applicable)
 Short-term projects 
 Part-time ongoing collaboration

 Preferred locations:
California (Bay Area / Los Angeles / San Diego / Sacramento)
Massachusetts (Boston / Cambridge)
Michigan (Detroit Metro / Novi / Ann Arbor)
Illinois (Chicago)
Georgia (Atlanta / Alpharetta / Sandy Springs)
Texas (Dallas / Austin / Houston)
New York / New Jersey
North Carolina (Raleigh / Charlotte)
Washington (Seattle)

Hybrid or onsite preferred. Remote for the right team.
