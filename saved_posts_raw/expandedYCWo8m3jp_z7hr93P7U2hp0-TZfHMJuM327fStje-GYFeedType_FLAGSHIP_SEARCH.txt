 Data Engineering Is Carving Shape From Raw Material

Raw data is like a block of wood full of potential, but unrefined.
Without shaping, its value stays hidden.

A Data Engineer does the carving:
 Shape structure
 Smooth rough edges
 Craft automated flow
 Reveal useful form

When shaped with care, data becomes something teams can build decisions on.

Great Data Engineering isnt about collecting more material.
Its about crafting it well.
