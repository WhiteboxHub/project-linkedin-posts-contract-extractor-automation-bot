Recognizing MNIST Digits with MLP: A Deep Dive

MNIST is the "Hello World" of deep learning. Here's how a multi-layer perceptron recognizes handwritten digits.

THE PROBLEM:
MNIST: 2828 pixel images of handwritten digits (0-9)
60,000 training images
Goal: Classify each image into the correct digit

THE ARCHITECTURE:
Input Layer: 784 neurons (2828 flattened)
Hidden Layer 1: 128 neurons (ReLU)
Hidden Layer 2: 64 neurons (ReLU)
Output Layer: 10 neurons (Softmax)

Why This Design:
784  128  64  10: Gradual dimensionality reduction
ReLU in hidden: Enables non-linear learning
Softmax in output: Converts to probabilities

FORWARD PROPAGATION:
Input: 2828 image  Flattened to 784 values (normalized 0-1)
Hidden Layer 1: h1 = ReLU(W1  input + b1)  128 features
Hidden Layer 2: h2 = ReLU(W2  h1 + b2)  64 features
Output: Softmax(W3  h2 + b3)  10 probabilities

Example:
Image of "7"  Forward  Output: [0.01, 0.02, ..., 0.82, ...]
Highest probability (0.82) at index 7  Prediction: "7"

LOSS FUNCTION:
Categorical Cross-Entropy
Compares predicted probabilities to the true label
Penalizes confident wrong predictions

BACKPROPAGATION:
Calculates gradients for each weight
Updates W1, W2, W3, b1, b2, b3
Learns digit patterns from training data

TRAINING PROCESS:
Forward: Image  MLP  Predictions
Loss: Compare prediction to true label
Backward: Compute gradients
Update: Adjust weights (Adam optimizer)
Repeat: Process all 60,000 images
Result: 98%+ accuracy

KEY INSIGHTS:
Hidden Layer 1 learns edges and curves
Hidden Layer 2 combines features into digit patterns
Softmax ensures probabilities sum to 1
ReLU enables non-linear feature extraction

THE REALITY:
MNIST is simple but teaches fundamentals:
Forward/backward propagation
Loss functions and optimization
Activation functions
Architecture design

THE LESSON:
MLPs can achieve 98%+ accuracy on MNIST with proper architecture, activations, and training. Understanding MNIST is the foundation for more complex computer vision tasks.
