I need a Sales Architect, not just an SDR.

At Lanspeed, weve spent 40 years building a reputation for unshakeable trust in the MSP space. Now, Im looking for a partner to help us scale that trust using modern tools.

I am hiring a 1099 Sales Architect to build our outbound engine from scratch.

This isn't a "fill a seat" role. I need someone who:

Knows the Stack: You know which AI tools actually work (and which are hype) and can build a seamless Apollo-centric system.

Solves the Data Problem: You know how to spin up a lightweight CRM layer so we can move fast without messing with our core PSA.

Can Actually Sell: Youll be the one taking the initial video calls. You need to be able to speak to a CEO or business owner without sounding like a script.

The Deal: 1099 Contract. Remote (US Only). $80-$100/hr.

If youve built a B2B sales engine from zero-to-one before, I want to see your blueprint.
